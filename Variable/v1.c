//Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.(int,float,char,etc)
//this is not possible in c
int myNum = 15;
printf(myNum);  // Nothing happens
//here we need to use %d(format specifier or a place holder )

//*If you don't want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, you can use the const keyword.
